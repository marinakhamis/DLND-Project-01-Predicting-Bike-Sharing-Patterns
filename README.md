# DLND-Project-01-Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns
Predicting Bike-Sharing Data (Your First Neural Network)
## **A. Introduction**

In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher-level tools such as PyTorch. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).
## **B. Instructions**

1. Download the project materials from our GitHub repository. You can get download the repository with git clone ```https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git.``` Our files in the GitHub repo are the most up to date, so it's the best place to get the project files.
    cd into the project-bikesharing directory.
2. Download anaconda or miniconda based on the instructions in the [Anaconda lesson](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd101/parts/2a9dba0b-28eb-4b0e-acfa-bdcf35680d90/modules/aba54606-cf35-4a77-b643-efec6a90bfa1/lessons/9e9ed61d-20c3-4431-95aa-a1099f28d601/concepts/4cdc5a26-1e54-4a69-8eb4-f15e37aaab7b).
   ```cmd
    conda create --name deep-learning python=3
   ```
3. Enter your new environment:
    - Mac/Linux: >>  ```source activate deep-learning ```
    - Windows: >> ``` activate deep-learning```
4. Ensure you have numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and jupyter notebook installed by doing the following:

    ```conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook```

5. Run the following to open up the notebook server:

    ``` jupyter notebook ```

6. Follow the instructions in the notebook; they will lead you through the project. You'll ultimately be editing the "my_answers.py" python file, whose components are imported into the notebook at various places.

7. Ensure you've passed the unit tests in the notebook and have taken a look at the rubric before you submit the project!
